This program was developed for an e-commerce retailer to sort inventory items that are awaiting shipment into a “pick list.” Items are sorted alphanumerically by their Stock Keeping Unit (SKU), which enables batch-picking of inventory items from the sizable inventory warehouse. Customer order data is ingested, cleaned, and normalized, then inserted into database tables using MySQL. All relevant data is then extracted and used to create the "pick list" for awaiting shipment orders. The result was an optimized order-processing pipeline, and a reduction in the time to pick inventory items by approximately 50 percent.
